## Motivation

The general idea is to provide a collaborative space where both Ruby devs, recruiters and even companies can come together to maintain and improve this platform.

### Goals

 * Create a simple yet scalable platform
 * The environment must always be open and inclusive
 * Companies and recruiters are always welcome to collaborate

## Collaborate

You can collaborate in several ways ...

### Developer

Improving the project, creating new features and correcting possible bugs.

If you have frontend skills, you can still help with the platform pages.

### Recruiters

Opening issues about suggestions for improvements and reporting problems.

We want to hear from you what you expect from a platform like this.

## Some questions that may arise

### Who can collaborate?

Anyone ... just open an issue and call the staff to discuss your need.

### Why should I collaborate?

**recruiters**: In order to have a quality, community driven and totally free option to find good and engaged Ruby devs.

**developers**: To have a nice place to follow good companies and vacancies related to the technology you work with.

### Do I have to pay to use the platform?

Absolutely not, the project is free to use and always will be!

### Why did we choose Jekyll?

At first we wanted the whole project to be very simple and as open and transparent as possible.

Using Jekyll, which besides being the official GitHub tool to create GitHub Pages is also written in Ruby, which makes creating plugins, writing codes and other activities more comfortable for Ruby devs.  =)

### Where do the job information go?

Jekyll is a tool that turns HTML and other file patterns into a static website.

This means that all jobs posted here on the platform are stored right here in this repository, in the `jobs/` directory.

### Who does this information belong to?

The information published on the portal is in common use by the entire community and the information submitted is the responsibility of the people who publish it.

Therefore, before publishing a job opportunity, be sure with the company that you have authorization to make it.
